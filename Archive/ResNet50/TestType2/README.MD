# ResNet50

## Description

This experiment is continuation of experiment on TestType1.<br><br>
This experiment however follows a breakthough of 96% test accuracy using Inception model. The idea is using Average of Maximums Pooling scheme rather than plain GlobalAverage Pooling. This notion can be observed from the usage of 4*4 Average pooling in previous experiment.
<br><br>
In [Experiment1] we achieve 96% validation accuracy (a breakthroug), however the test accuracy remained in range similar to previous experiment. In [Experiment3] we achieve 96% test and validation accuracy.
