# ResNet50

## Description

These are part of first experiments conducted on DeepWeeds. All the notebooks for experiemnts with ResNet50 and other models are built on top of these experiments and so forth.

The intentions of [DeepWeeds_KFold_Index0, DeepWeeds_KFold_Index1, DeepWeeds_KFold_Index2, DeepWeeds_KFold_Index3, DeepWeeds_KFold_Index4] to be included here is to justify the usage of 3rd fold (Index2) from 5Fold validation dataset generated by the authors of DeepWeeds paper. In the corresponding notebooks we observe that the 3rd fold gave highest accuracy of all. Thus, all the experiments here on forward uses 3rd fold for experiments. Occasional experiments have been conducted with different fold other than the 3rd, and the degraded performance was observed. Hence, the experiments stick with 3rd fold.

[Version24] is refactored version of [DeepWeeds_KFold_Index2] notebook. This is the first breakthrough in this research with 94% test accuracy, getting closer to 95.7% presented by the authors of DeepWeeds using ResNet50.
<br><br>
[Version31] is another breakthrough, where 95% barrier is crossed. Validation accuracy achieved is 95.8%. Here, instead of Global-Average Pooling, a 4*4 Average pooling used. The final feature size is 8192 when flattened, which is used for classification.
